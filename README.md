## Gettings sh*t done with Azure Functions (on AKS)!

All documentation and source code of the Techorama talk about Azure Functions, Kubernetes, AKS and more.

## Azure Functions

>Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without having to 
explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. Use Azure Functions to run a script or piece of code in 
response to a variety of events.

## Azure Kubernetes Service

>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) manages your hosted Kubernetes environment, making it quick and easy to 
deploy and manage containerized applications without container orchestration expertise. It also eliminates 
the burden of ongoing operations and maintenance by provisioning, upgrading, and scaling resources on 
demand, without taking your applications offline.
