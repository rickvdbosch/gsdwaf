# Getting sh\*t done with Azure Functions (on AKS)!

This session is packed with ways of making _you_ more productive with Azure Functions. From tips & tricks 
to running Azure Functions on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). From using Managed Identities to implementing 
the new Dependency Injection. Join us during this session and walk out with a well-filled toolbox ready to 
get sh\*t done with Azure Functions!

Running Azure Functions in AKS, or any other Kubernetes deployment, is very well possible. But be prepared for 
a few pitfalls. We will show you these pitfalls, and how to avoid them. 

If you use Managed Identities, your applications will be more secure. We'll tell you why, our demos will 
show you how! We'll use Managed Identities to securely connect to other Azure resources like Azure Key Vault.

Azure Functions V 2.x now supports Dependency Injection, leveraging the ASP.NET Core Dependency Injection 
features. We will show you how to configure and use DI.
